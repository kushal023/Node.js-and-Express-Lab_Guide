    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kushal Chauhan. I am living in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh.
    Some of my favorite things to do are read, 
    listen to music, and ride public transportation (buses and trains).
    These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
    My career aspirations are to become a great software
    engineer. I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
    person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members, especially
    my mom, as a guiding figure in life. Favorite shows of mine include 
    Doctor Who, Sherlock, Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins' and Dives), Hustle,
    and Chopped (yes, the majority of those are British TV shows, problem, mate?).
    Just a few things about yours truly</p>
